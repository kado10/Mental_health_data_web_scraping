# Mental health data web scraping

This script is for personal interest and aims to process lots of monthly files in one go tracing back to 2016 and deals with a period where there was a format change. The final dataset is in a format that will enable you to publish monthly reporting although it may require transofrming to the latest geographical boundaries depending on which geography you would like to look at. The logic could then be recycled and the dataset appended to future iterations to enable regular monthly reporting using this dataset. Although some levels of data do contain lots of suppressions due to small numbers and there are some issues with data quality the dataset is a useful source of information for data monitoring.
