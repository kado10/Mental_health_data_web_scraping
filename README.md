# Mental health data web scraping

This project is for personal interest, so far this script web scrapes all of the historical mental health services monthly datasets with final in the link going back to 2016. More work will be going into this project so that the data can then be transformed into key insights at a CCG level. It is currently kicking out two datasets which need to be merged together, this is because in 2018 there was a format change.
